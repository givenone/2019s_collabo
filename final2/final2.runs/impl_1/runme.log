WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/UUT/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/UUT/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/UUT/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
